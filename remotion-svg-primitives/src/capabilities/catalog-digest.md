# Capability catalog — reusable craft menu

> Reusable craft catalog for the remotion-svg-primitives lesson pipeline. Source of truth for SHAPE is src/capabilities/schema.ts; source of truth for WHAT EXISTS is the code (barrels + unions). This JSON is a report-only baseline in cut 1.
>
> Source of truth for SHAPE: `src/capabilities/schema.ts`. Source of truth for WHAT EXISTS: the component barrels + `EASE`/`SPRING` keys. This menu is generated — never hand-edited.

**Coverage:** 48/48 catalog entries have hand-authored prose. Undocumented entries exist and are gated, but their menu text is pending.

## SVG teaching primitives

### Counting & number (`counting`)

| id | component | variants | use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `answer-tile` | `AnswerTile` | — | A tappable answer or choice card holding a number, text, or icon child, with correct/wrong/selected/focused states and a state badge. |

| `region-split` | `RegionSplit` | — | Splitting ONE filled round region (a cookie/disk) into N equal-area parts to teach halves/thirds/quarters: cutProgress draws the cuts on, highlightPart shades one part, separation pulls the parts out to hand each to someone. |
